Analysis of videocystometry in mice
The VCanalysis.ipf runs in Igor Pro 8 or higher. 
Upon compiling, it creates the videocystometry menu. 
VCAnalyses is used to extract videocystometric parameters from combined pressure-volume measurements. These can be saved via SaveVCAnalysis. Figure1_VCA.xlsx provides a test file for this type of analysis.
menuVCA opens a tab where videocystometric movies (tiff format) can be loaded, and automatically analysed for volume and border movement. Video 1 provides a test file for this type of analysis.
